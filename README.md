Address DB

This is a simple project created for my uncle for record-keeping the addresses of his customers.
The web-app is designed to provide basic CRUD operations to the Admin for Customer operations.
The app uses AngularJS for front-end and NodeJS for backend although actual data is maintained by FireBase.
